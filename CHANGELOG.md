## Next release

Changelog starts.

* Default MQTT topics live under 'homeassistant', like everything else, rather than 'home-assistant'. You may need to update your config to match.

* README updated to include info on installing as a Home Assistant local add-on.

* Repository moves to 'git-flow'.  Latest developments will be on the 'develop' branch.  Releases will be on 'master'.
